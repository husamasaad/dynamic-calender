# Calender

This App was built to practice working with Dates, it is a Responsive dynamic Calender with an events lists.
I built this following along with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1devGCrm2Y) and tried to adjust the design a little more

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- traverse through the calender with all the years and monthes
- add events to the days that they want
- events added will be save in the localStorage
